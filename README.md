#Re quirements
to run this, you require

- MySQL Server on port 3306 (this is the default)
- NodeJS
- npm (comes with NodeJS)
- an internet connection

<br /><br /><br />

# Running
## MacOS / Linux
In MacOS and Linux, the commands are the same, use

```
	npm run unix:init
```

to install all dependencies, then use

```
	npm run unix:dev
```

to start the server, this'll also serve the front-end

<br /><br /><br />

## Windows
this is untested but it should work, let me know if it doesnt idk windows its bad

```
	npm run win:init
```

to install dependencies

```
	npm run win:dev
```
